## Why are We Doing This?
We come from a world where there is an idea of [Software Craftsmanship], where we focus on more than just specifications.

## Facilitators: Think about...
- Experience levels need to be close
- start by randomly assigning pairs?
- name tags?
- list of three favorite langauges to bring to the party?
- make sure at least one in the pair has TDD experiene (what if you don't?)
- make sure at least one in the pair has some pairing experience (what if you don't?)
