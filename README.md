# Organizing a Code Retreat

Things to keep in mind when organizing a code retreat; 
A brief history of Code Retreatâ„¢ events that have been held in Denver; 
What things cost, where to get them, and how to get sponsorship so procurement can happen;
Ideas about how to get a large group of people to play well together and imagine the same things.

## Upcoming: 2015
The [Global Day of Code Retreat](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/) is scheduled for November 14, 2015. Interested in helping to organize the event? I think it might be interesting to use Github, exclusively, to organize the event. Create an issue in this repository and we'll start working on it together.
