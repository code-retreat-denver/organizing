# Organizing a Code Retreat

Things to keep in mind when organizing a code retreat; 
A brief history of Code Retreatâ„¢ events that have been held in Denver; 
What things cost, where to get them, and how to get sponsorship so procurement can happen;
Ideas about how to get a large group of people to play well together and imagine the same things.

## 2012
Cory Flanigan and Solomon White organized a GDCR event at Uncubed (when it was still on Walnut). 

## 2013
Jeffrey Mathias and folks from Sendgrid? Cory? I missed this one...

## 2014
Cory introduced me to Abby, and we organized the event. November 15th? We held the event at Pivotal Labs in Denver, CO. 15 people attended, with exposure levels from 0 - 100%; everyone learned something new and tried to delete their code between pairing sessions.

## Upcoming: 2015
The [Global Day of Code Retreat](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/) is scheduled for November 14, 2015. Interested in helping to organize the event? I think it might be interesting to use Github, exclusively, to organize the event. Create an issue in this repository and we'll start working on it together.
